# Continentuiz - Escape the Jungle Quiz Game

an interactive quiz game about continents with a mysterious jungle story


you play as alex a young explorer trapped in a mysterious jungle. to escape you must answer questions about the seven continents correctly. one wrong answer and youre lost forever


I build this game because i want to learn more about the continents so i thought it would be better to make a game based on it.

The game is build in html, css and js. 

In this project i struggled with managing multiple game states and screen transitions, implementing countdown timers with setInterval and proper cleanup, 

dynamically creating and manipulating DOM elements, designing complex CSS keyframe animations for the jungle theme, handling event listeners to prevent bugs, and 

building game logic that combines question arrays by difficulty while tracking scores with point deductions for hints and skips.
